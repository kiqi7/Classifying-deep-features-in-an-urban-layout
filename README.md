# Classifying deep features in an urban layout

It is offered a type of street network to capture the character of urban layout and category different places around the world. Deep learning algorithm is been study performances of hyper-parameters modify.

## [Database](https://github.com/kiqi7/Classifying-deep-features-in-an-urban-layout/tree/master/Drive_4km)
Access OpenStreetMap to generate dataset

### [10 different cities are selected to make the layout classification](https://github.com/kiqi7/Classifying-deep-features-in-an-urban-layout/tree/master/City%20Boundary)
**London, Beijing, Paris, Moscow, Los Angeles, Bangkok, New York, Sydney, Mumbai and Amsterdam**

*City Edge Example: Log Angeles and related Coordinate points*
